# Guides

The goal of this tutorial is to perform tasks with Scanner on Kubernetes.

## Objectives

- To see Scanner's behaviours
- To see usage of API resources (`ImageReview` and `WorkloadReview`)
- To see usage of `scanner-cli`

## Before you begin

You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube).

To check the version, enter `kubectl version`.

## Scanner's Behaviours

- To see how Scanner behaves, look at the working examples for supported workload types [here](/products/scanner/0.1.0/guides/workloads)
- To see how to use `ImageReview` look at [here](/products/scanner/0.1.0/guides/imagereview)
- To see how to use `WorkloadReview` look at [here](/products/scanner/0.1.0/guides/workloadreview)
- To see how to use `scanner-cli`, look at [here](/products/scanner/0.1.0/guides/scanner-cli)
